Hi!

My name is Brecht.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in audio engineering at the [Centre for Digital Music](http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/digitalmusic/), part of the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk). I [published](/publications.html) and presented research on [perception](http://brechtdemancom.ipage.com/downloads/aes136_eBrief151.pdf) of [recording](http://brechtdemancom.ipage.com/downloads/aes134.pdf) and mixing engineering, [intelligent audio effects](http://brechtdemancom.ipage.com/downloads/aes53.pdf) and [mixing](http://arpjournal.com/2639/a-semantic-approach-to-autonomous-mixing/) [systems](http://brechtdeman.com/downloads/aes135.pdf), and [analysis](http://www.terasoft.com.tw/conf/ismir2014/proceedings/T025_293_Paper.pdf) of music production [practices](http://www.terasoft.com.tw/conf/ismir2014/LBD/LBD15.pdf).   

Prior to this, I received a BSc and MSc in Electronic Engineering at the [University of Ghent ](https://www.ugent.be)(_Universiteit Gent_) in Belgium, during which I also studied at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://www.ethz.ch) in Zürich (_Eidgenössische Technologische Hochschule Zürich_) in Switzerland for one year at MSc level. 

I am a [recording and mixing engineer](/music.html), in and around London, UK.   

I play the piano (jazz and pop) both in bands and solo. 
I also teach piano, audio engineering and music production. All levels (beginner to advanced), all genres (from classical via jazz over pop to electronic music).  

An active member of the [Audio Engineering Society](http://www.aes.org), I was chair of its [Student Delegate Assembly](https://www.facebook.com/AESsda) for Europe and International Regions from 2014 to 2016, and am currently committee member of the [British Section](http://www.aes-uk.org) and chair of the [London UK Student Section](https://www.facebook.com/AESLondonUKStudentSection). I also chaired the 2015 edition of the annual AES student event [Up Your Output!](http://www.aes-uk.org/up/) at SAE London and remain active in its organising committee.   

Please check '[Music](/music.html)' for a very limited selection of musical works and productions I've been involved in, '[Blog](/blog.html)' for a weblog about my research and other activities, '[Publications](/publications.html)' for an overview of my published work, '[Software](/software.html)' for development work available online, and [contact me](mailto:info@brechtdeman.com) to enquire about hiring, lessons, collaborations or a cup of coffee.
