Hi!

My name is Brecht.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in audio engineering at the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk), part of the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk). I'm funded by and closely collaborating with [Yamaha Corporation](https://www.yamaha.com/). 
I [published](/publications/) and presented research on [perception](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/2015/DeMan%20Reiss%20-%20AES138.pdf) of [recording](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/DeMan%20Reiss%20-%20A%20Pairwise%20and%20Multiple%20Stimuli%20Approach%20to%20Perceptual%20Evaluation%20of%20Microphone%20Types.pdf) and [mixing engineering](http://arpjournal.com/analysis-of-peer-reviews-in-music-production/), [intelligent audio effects](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/DeMan%20Reiss%20-%20AES53.pdf) and [mixing](http://arpjournal.com/2639/a-semantic-approach-to-autonomous-mixing/) [systems](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/De%20Man%20Reiss%20-%20AES135.pdf), and [analysis](http://www.terasoft.com.tw/conf/ismir2014/proceedings/T025_293_Paper.pdf) of [music production](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/documents/2015/Ronan%20-%20The%20impact%20of%20subgrouping%20practices%20on%20the%20perception%20of%20multitrack%20mixes.pdf) [practices](http://www.terasoft.com.tw/conf/ismir2014/LBD/LBD15.pdf).   

Prior to this, I received a BSc and MSc in Electronic Engineering at the [University of Ghent ](https://www.ugent.be)(_Universiteit Gent_) in Belgium, during which I also studied at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://www.ethz.ch) in Zürich (_Eidgenössische Technologische Hochschule Zürich_) in Switzerland for one year at MSc level. 

I am a [recording and mixing engineer](/music/), in and around London, UK.   

I play the piano (jazz and pop) both in bands and solo. 
I also teach piano, audio engineering and music production. All levels (beginner to advanced), all genres (from classical via jazz over pop to electronic music).  

An active member of the [Audio Engineering Society](http://www.aes.org), I am Vice Chair of the Education Committee, committee member of the [British Section](http://www.aes-uk.org) and chair of the [London UK Student Section](https://www.facebook.com/AESLondonUKStudentSection), and was chair of its [Student Delegate Assembly](https://www.facebook.com/AESsda) for Europe and International Regions from 2014 to 2016. I also chaired the 2015 edition of the annual AES student event [Up Your Output!](http://www.aes-uk.org/up/) at SAE London and remain active in its organising committee.   

Please check '[Music](/music/)' for a very limited selection of musical works and productions I've been involved in, '[Blog](/blog/)' for a weblog about my research and other activities, '[Publications](/publications/)' for an overview of my published work, '[Software](/software/)' for development work available online, and [contact me](mailto:info@brechtdeman.com) to enquire about hiring, lessons, collaborations or a cup of coffee.
