For the very short introductory presentation of my PhD's [viva voce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_voce), I made this 'website' instead of the usual Beamer, Keynote, or Powerpoint, because I needed to embed some tools I (co)created. 

You can see the result [here](/downloads/viva/presentation/01/01opening.html). 

Depending on browser, screen size and so on it may look weird - it was specifically created for a particular projector in a particular room in Queen Mary University of London. 
In terms of content it does not make much sense on its own, showing only graphs and tools, and lacking explanatory text. 
It is posted for the implementation only.
