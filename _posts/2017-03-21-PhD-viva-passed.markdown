Today I passed my PhD viva (from *viva voce*, UK term for oral defence or examination of doctoral dissertation) subject to 'the usual minor corrections'. 
My thesis was titled 'Towards a better understanding of mix engineering', and [can be downloaded here](/publications/pdf/PhD-thesis.pdf). 

Since submitting I have been working in the same lab as a postdoctoral research assistant.
