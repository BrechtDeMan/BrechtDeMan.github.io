This seems great, it uses *Github*-flavoured markdown and seems geared towards developers with minimalist streak.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python linenos %}
if a is not None:
    print(a)
{% endhighlight %}

and using MathJax I can also easily generate LaTeX math.
