Audio material for a paper to be presented at the 8th Art of Record Production Conference in Québec City, 12–14 July [<a href="#ref1" target="_self">1</a>], and the 135th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in New York City, 17–20 October [<a href="#ref2" target="_self">2</a>]. 

Raw multitracks from [Weathervane Music's Shaking Through](www.shakingthrough.com). Compared are a knowledge-engineered autonomous mixing system (_KEAMS_ - subject of the research), an autonomous mixing system solely based on extracted, low-level signal features (_VST_), two human mixing engineers (_amateur_ and _pro_) and a sum of the peak-normalised, raw audio (_sum_).
